      <strong>Project 2:</strong> Potential Field Navigation
    </header>

    <p><font size="+2"><strong>Due November 1st, 2021 at 11:59 PM.</strong></font></p>

    <p>In <a href="a1.html">Project 1</a>, we saw that we can control the robot to maintain a goal distance to the wall by correcting the control signals based on the observed sensor data. Now, we want the robot to be able to autonomously navigate to a goal location.</p>

    <p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/p2/potential_field.png" alt=""/></span>
      In Project 2, we will accomplish autonomous navigation using <strong>potential field control</strong>. We can imagine that our goal is a magnet, pulling the robot towards it. We can treat obstacles like repelling forces, pushing the robot away. If we combine these two forces, we might get a potential field that looks like the example on the left. To get to the goal, our robot can follow the path of least resistance, moving in the direction of the strongest force at its location at each time step.</p>

    <p>For this project, you will write code in C++ to calculate the potential fields the robot needs to reach a goal without colliding with any obstacles. You will be given a map which tells you where the obstacles are, along with a start and goal position. </p>

    <p>This project will be done in teams of 2 or 3. The instructors will assign teammates.</p>

    <h2 id="getting_code">Getting the Code</h2>

    <p>One repository per team will be created for this project. All teammates will have access to the repository and will be able to view it and make changes. All teammates will share ownership of the code and receive credit for writing the code through the license file.</p>

    <p><strong>The invite link to accept the assignment on Github Classroom can be found on Slack.</strong></p>

    <p>Create a GitHub Classroom team named <strong>P2 UM Team &#35;</strong> for UM students, and <strong>P2 Berea Team &#35;</strong> for Berea students. Replace <strong>&#35;</strong> with the team number assigned to you. See <a href="a1.html#getting_code">Project 1 instructions</a> for more details.</p>

    <p>Some parts of the provided code run on your comupter, in a Docker container. Others run on the robot. You will be cloning the repository on both your computer and the robot. This command clones the repository:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">git clone &lt;ADDRESS&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>Substitute the address to your repository. On the robot, run this command in the home directory of the Raspberry Pi, in a terminal opened in a VSCode remote session to the robot (see the <a href="/tutorials/robot.html#sec_conn_robot">robot tutorial</a>). <strong>Use the SSH address to clone the repository on the robot</strong> (see instructions <a href="/tutorials/robot.html#sec_code_robot">here</a>).</p>

    <p>On your computer, run the clone command <strong>in the folder you created for ROB 102 code in Project 0</strong>. For most of you, that is a folder called &quot;rob102-code&quot;, or something similar, in your Documents folder. Use <code>cd</code> in your terminal to go to this folder before running the clone command.</p>

      <h2><a href="#code">Code Overview</a></h2>
    </header>

    <p>There are three different code executables that can be run for Project 2:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Navigation web server:</strong>
        This code is stored in <code>src/web_server.cpp</code> and runs <em>in the Docker container</em>, running on your laptop.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Robot potential field navigation:</strong>
        This code is stored in <code>src/robot_potential_field.cpp</code> and runs <em>on the robot</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tests:</strong>
        There is one test for Project 2, for Part 0, that is written in <code>src/tests/test_graph.cpp</code> and runs <em>in the Docker container</em>, running on your laptop.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="code_web">Running the Webapp in the Docker</h3>

    <p>Follow the instructions in the <a href="/tutorials/app.html">Webapp Tutorial</a>. There is also a video demonstration linked on Slack.</p>

    <h3 id="code_robot">Running Potential Field Navigation on the Robot</h3>

    <p>The code to perform potential field navigation on the robot is in <code>src/robot_potential_field.cpp</code>. Before you run the code, you should <a href="/labs/lab4_navigation_workflow.pdf">make a map</a> of the environment you want to run in. Then, run the localization using the map you just made (see <a href="/labs/lab5_potential_field_nav.pdf">Lab 5</a>).</p>

    <p>To compile and run potential field navigation on the robot, connect to the robot using VSCode (as described in the <a href="/tutorials/robot.html#sec_robot_prog">robot tutorial</a>). Then, from inside the repository you cloned onto the robot for Project 2, compile as follows:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">cd build
cmake -DOMNIBOT=On ..
make</code></pre>
    <p>Do not forget the argument <code>-DOMNIBOT=On</code> when running CMake. This is how the compiler knows whether to compile the robot code (which is not compiled by default in the Docker). To run the potential field controller, in the <code>build</code> folder where you compiled, do:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">./robot_potential_field [PATH/TO/MAP] [goal_x] [goal_y]</code></pre>
    <p>The map is stored in <code>~/botlab-bin/maps/current.map</code>. Use that path if you did not move the map since creating it. You can also pass in <code>goal_x</code> and <code>goal_y</code>, the global position of the goal, relative to the starting position of your map, in meters. If you do not pass these in, they will default to zero.</p>

    <p>When you pass in arguments to the code, do not include the square brackets.</p>

    <h3 id="code_utils">Provided Utility Functions</h3>

    <p>To use provided functions, all you need to do is include the correct header file. The needed header files should already be included in the templates. Check the header files (in folder <code>include/autonomous_navigation/</code>) for all the functions available, and the associated documentation. Some robot functions, including <code>drive(vx, vy, wz)</code>, and some other helpers, are the same as in <a href="a1.html#code">Project 1</a>. Below are a few of the functions you will likely find helpful, from the header <code>include/autonomous_navigation/utils/graph_utils.h</code> (implemented in <code>src/utils/graph_utils.cpp</code>). Other than those marked, these are implemented for you.</p>

    <p>This assignment has the following parts:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><a href="#sec_graph">Part 0</a>: Indexing into the Grid Graph</li>
      <li><a href="#sec_goal">Part 1</a>: Creating an attractive goal potential field</li>
      <li><a href="#sec_dt">Part 2</a>: Implementing the Distance Transform algorithm</li>
      <li><a href="#sec_pfield">Part 3</a>: Creating a potential field and performing navigation</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We also provide an advanced extension to implement the <a href="#sec_euclidean_dt">distance transform with Euclidean distance</a>, as discussed in lecture. Most of your time should be spent on Parts 2 and 3.</p>

    <p>We will be compiling and executing all the code written on your computer in a Docker container. We have created a web app which you can use to visualize your code. Review the <a href="/tutorials/app.html">webapp tutorial</a> and make sure that you can run the webapp in the Docker container before continuing with this assignment.</p>

    <h3 id="sec_graph">Part 0: Grid Graph</h3>

    <p>Information about the map for a particular environment is stored in a provided struct called <code>GridGraph</code>, described in <a href="#code_utils_gridgraph">the code overview</a>. You can visualize the available maps using the <a href="/tutorials/app.html">web app</a>.</p>

    <p>You should complete the functions <code>cellToIdx()</code> and <code>idxToCell()</code>, which convert between cells and indices as discussed in <a href="/labs/lab4_navigation_workflow.pdf">Lab 4</a>. You can use these functions for the following parts of the project.</p>

    <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo0_1">P2.0.1:</strong> In the file <code>graph_utils.cpp</code>, complete functions <code>cellToIdx()</code> and <code>idxToCell()</code>.
        <code>cellToIdx()</code> should accept a cell coordinate and a graph as arguments, and return an <code>int</code> containing the corresponding array index for the cell.
        <code>idxToCell()</code> should accept an array index and a graph as arguments, and return a <code>Cell</code> containing the corresponding cell coordinate for the array index.</li>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We have provided a test script to check your indexing functions. Compile your code in the Docker container (using the <a href="/tutorials/app.html#write_code">instructions in the tutorial</a>), then run the test script in the Docker like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">cd /code/build
cmake ..
make
./test_graph</code></pre>

    <p>The tests should pass before you move on to the next step. You may add more tests if you would like.</p>

    <h3 id="sec_goal">Part 1: The Goal Field</h3>

    <p>In this part, you will write an attractive field to pull the robot towards the goal location. You will test your function on the robot. You can also use the web app to test the function.</p>

    <p>First, complete function <code>createAttractiveField()</code> in file <code>src/potential_field/potential_field.cpp</code> so that it accepts the current graph and a goal cell and returns a vector representing the attractive field. The field should be a vector with the same length as the graph cell data, and should be indexed the same way.</p>

    <p>Next, modify the code in <code>src/robot_potential_field.cpp</code> so that it uses the function <code>createAttractiveField()</code> to drive to a goal. Create a map using the localization code provided, and pick a goal in that map. The template code uses the provided function <code>localSearch()</code> to get a 2D vector pointing towards the next location in the potential field to explore. Use this vector to create velocity commands to send to the robot. At this point, your robot will not be able to avoid obstacles, so make sure you pick a start and goal position so that your robot doesn't collide with anything.</p>

    <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_1">P2.1.1:</strong> In the file <code>potential_field.cpp</code>, complete function <code>createAttractiveField()</code> to return a vector corresponding to an attractive potential field towards a given goal.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_2">P2.1.2:</strong> Modify <code>robot_potential_field.cpp</code> so that it gets an attractive potential field to a goal, then drives in the direction returned by the <code>localSearch()</code> function. When the robot reaches a minimum in the field, <code>localSearch()</code> will return a vector of zeros. Test your code on the robot.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="hint">
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong>
        An attractive field where the value of each cell is the distance to the goal location works when this is the only field.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong>
        Use your indexing functions to convert between Cell types and indices, and your distance function to calculate distances between cells.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong>
        You can visualize your attractive field in the web app by setting the vector <code>potential_field</code> in the function <code>createPotentialField()</code> to be equal to the attractive field. The field will be visualized when you plan using the &quot;Potential Field&quot; option in the web app.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong>
        The local search function returns a vector containing three elements: <code>{vx, vy, grad}</code>. The first two, <code>vx</code> and <code>vy</code>, make a <em>unit vector</em> (with magnitude 1) pointing in the direction of the largest decrease in potential from the current location of the robot. The last element represents the magnitude of decrease in potential between the cell the robot is in, and the next cell in the direction of the vector. You might want to use it to control the velocity of the robot in your navigation algorithm.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="sec_dt">Part 2: Distance Transform</h3>

    <p>In this part, you will implement a distance transform, which will calculate the distance from each cell to the nearest obstacle. This part can be implemented entirely on your computer in the Docker, using the web app (no robot needed). It should look something like the image below. The grey cells represent smaller distances to the nearest obstacle, and the white cells represent higher distances.</p>

    <span class="image main"><img src="/images/p2/dist_tf.png" alt="" style="max-width:600px;"/></span>

    <p>We will be implementing a <strong>binary distance transform</strong>, which calculates the distance from each cell to the nearest occupied cell. For occupied cells, the distance should be zero.</p>

    <p>We will start by implementing a slow version of the distance transform which gives us the Euclidean distance to each cell. Implement this algorithm in the function <code>distanceTransformSlow()</code> located in <code>src/potential_field/distance_transform.cpp</code>. For each unoccupied cell, calculate the distance between the current cell and every occupied cell in the graph. Store the smallest distance in the <code>graph.obstacle_distances</code> vector.
      <!-- This implementation doesn't use any tricks to perform the transform more quickly. The complexity is <i>O(N<sup>2</sup>)</i> because the algorithm needs to loop through <i>N</i> cells for each of the <i>N</i> cells, resulting in <i>N*N = N<sup>2</sup></i> operations. You should notice that this takes a lot of time for big graphs! -->

        In the <code>distance_transform.cpp</code> file, complete function <code>distanceTransformSlow()</code>. It should accept a graph and populate the <code>graph.obstacle_distances</code> vector with the Euclidean distance to the nearest occupied cell.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>You should make sure to test your algorithm on multiple different maps. You can use the web app to visualize the distances as a gradient. It should look like the image at the beginning of this page.</p>

    <ul class="hint">
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong> You can visualize your transform in the web app by modifying the function <code>distanceTransform()</code> so that it calls <code>distanceTransformSlow()</code>.

      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong> Can you make your algorithm any faster?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Next, we will implement a much faster algorithm for computing the distance transform, but which computes the Manhattan distance from each unoccupied cell to the nearest occupied cell. Implement this algorithm in the function <code>distanceTransformManhattan()</code> located in <code>src/potential_field/distance_transform.cpp</code>. You should implement the 2D Manhattan distance transform algorithm presented in lecture. You can visualize your distance transform by modifying the function <code>distanceTransform()</code> so that it calls <code>distanceTransformManhattan()</code>, just like for the slow version you completed.</p>

    <h3 id="sec_pfield">Part 3: Potential Field Navigation</h3>

    <p>Now, you will combine the attractive field from <a href="#sec_goal">Part 1</a> and the distance transform from <a href="#sec_goal">Part 2</a> into a single potential field. Transform the distance transform stored in <code>graph.obstacle_distances</code> into a repulsive field in function <code>createRepulsiveField()</code> in file <code>src/potential_field/potential_field.cpp</code>. Then, modify <code>createPotentialField()</code> in the same file to combine the two. You might want to modify <code>createAttractiveField()</code> for this part.</p>

    <p>You should test your field in the web app, and when you are satisfied with the result, try it out on the robot. Modify the code in <code>src/robot_potential_field.cpp</code> to call the function <code>createPotentialField()</code>. The robot should now be able to navigate without colliding into obstacles. It will only avoid obstacles that are in its map, not dynamic obstacles, like people walking in front of it, so be careful!</p>

    <ul class="hint">
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong>
        The distance transform is HIGH in places that are far from an obstacle and LOW in places that are close to an obstacle.

What kind of function can you apply to the distances to convert the distance transform to a field?

        Experiment with a few different functions and parameters to find one that works. You should make sure that the function works for a variety of start and goal locations and maps.

    <h3 id="sec_results">Project Webpage: Results &amp; Reflection Questions</h3>

    <p>On your project webpage, include a brief description (a few sentences) of your approach for each part. Include lots of images of how your algorithm works on the web app and the robot, as well as at least one video demo of your robot completing potential field navigation in <a href="sec_pfield">Part 3</a>. You might also consider taking videos of tests you complete on the web app using a screen recording software.</p>

    <p>Include a discussion section on the web page, where you discuss the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The strengths of your potential field navigation algorithm</li>
      <li>The limitations of your potential field navigation algorithm</li>
      <li>How you might improve the algorithm (include at least one idea)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In addition, consider these questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Can you make the naive distance transform any faster (without implementing the fast algorithm we discussed in lecture)? If so, consider trying your idea!</li>
      <li>How does the Euclidean distance transform differ from the Manhattan one? How do they compare in terms of speed?</li>
      <li>What function did you select for your attrative and repulsive fields? How did you combine them to create a potential field?</li>
      <li>When and why does your potential field algorithm fail?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Include images or videos whenever possible to illustrate your points. Keep the discussion brief: it should be no longer than two or three paragraphs.</p>

      The notes describe an algorithm presented in a research paper which is available <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~pff/papers/dt.pdf">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>As an advanced extension, you can implement the fast Euclidean distance transform described in the notes linked above. The function <code>distanceTransformEuclidean2D()</code> is provided in the file <code>src/potential_field/distance_transform.cpp</code> to implement the algorithm. You may use function <code>distanceTransformEuclidean1D()</code> to implement the 1D version of the algorithm which is used within the 2D algorithm.</p>
