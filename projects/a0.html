    <p>This project will introduce programming concepts in C++. The goal of the following activities is to prepare you to implement algorithms in C++. All the code will be compiled and executed in Replit.</p>

    <h3 id="pocket_calc">Programming a Pocket Calculator (15 points)</h3>

    <p>During lecture, we will go through how to program a pocket calculator in C++. You should implement the calculator in the provided template file, which is called <code>main.cpp</code>.

    <p>
      <strong>We will go through implementing these features to build up our pocket calculator together in the lectures</strong> (see the <a href="/index.html#sec_schedule">schedule</a> for links to lecture content).
      The list below summarizes features which your pocket calculator should implement. Use them as a checklist before submitting your assignment.
      <!-- You are welcome to work on the assignment on your own time if you would like. -->
    </p>

    <p>The project on Replit provides some automated tests, accessible in the left panel of the Replit project. These tests should all pass. However, these tests are not sufficient to ensure your code is working. You should test your code thoroughly with your own test cases.</p>

    <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_1">P0.0 (1 point):</strong>
        In the file <code>LICENSE.txt</code> included in the project template, replace <code>&lt;COPYRIGHT HOLDER&gt;</code> with your name.
        Replace <code>&lt;YEAR&gt;</code> with the current year.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_1">P0.1 (3 points):</strong>
        Perform arithmetic operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for two numeric values and print the values, the operation, and their result to the screen.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_2">P0.2 (3 points):</strong>
        Prompt a user to enter values and operators to the calculator. The program should take as input real valued numbers for the operands, and a character for the operator, and store these values in variables.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_3">P0.3 (3 points):</strong>
        Create a function that computes a single arithmetic operation. The function should be given as input two floating point operands and a character that specifies the operation to be performed.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_4">P0.4 (3 points):</strong>
        Iterate over an execution loop that performs an infinite number of subsequent arithmetic operations given from user input, until the user specifies the operator &apos;q&apos; for quit.  Output the result accumulated over subsequently performed operations.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_5">P0.5 (2 points):</strong>
        Check whether the user has provided valid input for the operator. If the input is invalid, display an error message and request the input again.
      </li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

  </header>

  <p>Advanced extensions are optional features which you may complete for up to 4 additional points total in the course. They are due by the <strong>final grading deadline (December 9, 2022)</strong>. They do not need to be completed by the deadline for this project. See the <a href="/syllabus.html#adv_ext">syllabus</a> for details.</p>

  <ul class="todo">
    <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
      <strong><a href="#todoAE_1_i">Advanced Extension P0.i</a> (1 extension point):</strong>
      Enable the user to undo their last operation by specifying &apos;u&apos; as the operator.
    </li>
    <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
      <strong><a href="#todoAE_1_ii">Advanced Extension P0.ii</a> (1 extension point):</strong>

    <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
      <strong><a href="#todoAE_1_iv">Advanced Extension P0.iv</a> (1 extension point):</strong>
      Enable the user to store and load their current set of operations through a file named &quot;resultcalc.txt&quot; such that this equation can be used across multiple program executions.
