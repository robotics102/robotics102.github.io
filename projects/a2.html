    <h2><a href="#project">Project Description</a></h2>
  </header>

    <p>In this project, we will implement our first autonomous navigation algorithm: the Bug 0 Algorithm.</p>

    <p>
      The Bug Algorithm navigates by driving towards the goal, while checking for obstacles in the path.
      If the robot encounters an obstacle while driving to the goal, it drives around the obstacle until the path to the goal is clear again.
      We drive around around obstacles using a Wall Follower, with the same algorithm as in <a href="/projects/a1.html">Project 1</a>.
    </p>



    <h3 id="robot_hits_the_spot">Robot Hits the Spot</h3>

    <p>
      The first step is to navigate to a given goal position and angle.
      In <a href="/projects/a1.html#sec_square">Project 1, Part 1</a>, we wrote a program that drove in a square by sending velocity commands to the robot.
      The square was not very accurate because we had no way of checking whether the robot had acheived the desired position.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, we will use the robot's <emph>odometry</emph> to ensure that the robot navigates to the desired goal.
      You should compare the robot's current pose with the goal pose to compute the velocity command for the robot.
      Your program should stop when the robot has reached the goal.
    </p>

    <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1">P2.1 Robot Hits the Spot (4 points):</strong>
        Write an algorithm that drives the robot to a desired goal pose.
        You should implement this algorithm in the function <code>driveToPose()</code> in the file <code>hit_the_spot.cpp</code>.
        To get full points for this task, you should demo your robot driving to a series of goals given by course staff.
        Print the robot's pose after each goal has been reached.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="bug">Bug Navigation</h3>

    <p>Once we can drive to a goal location, we will encorporate avoiding obstacles using Wall Following.
      We will implement the Bug 0 Algorithm as a State Machine which switches between two states: driving towards the goal, and wall following around obstacles.
      The algorithm continues until the goal is reached, doing the following at each iteration:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Check whether the robot should be in the drive to goal state or the wall following state.</li>
      <li>Compute the velocity command which drives towards the goal <i>OR</i> follows the obstacle, depending on the state.</li>
      <li>Send the command to the robot.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      First, you will need to determine which state your robot is in.
      If the path to the goal has an obstacle, the robot should be in a wall following state.
      In Project 1, we wrote a function to find the minimum ray in the Lidar scan.
      This time, we want to know if there is an obstacle along the path to the goal.
      You should complete the function <code>findMinRayInSlice()</code> which will tell us the minimum ray in a specific slice of the Lidar scan which points in the direction of our go.
    </p>

    <ul class="todo">

      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo2">P2.2 (1 point):</strong>
        Complete the function <code>findMinRayInSlice()</code> which finds the index of the minimum ray in a slice of the Lidar scan.
        The slice should be centered around <code>target_angle</code>, passed as input to the function.
        The slice should encompass rays within <code>slice_size</code> radians of <code>target_angle</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="hint">
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        You can reuse parts of your function <code>findMinRay()</code> from Project 1.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        The function <code>wrapAngle()</code> will be helpful.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Use the function <code>findMinRayInSlice()</code> to determine which state the robot is in.
      Print out the state of the robot at each iteration of the algorithm.
    </p>

    <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo3">P2.3 (1 point):</strong>
        Determine the state of the robot at each iteration and print the current state to the screen.
        Course staff should be able to read the output to determine whether your bug navigation is correctly transitioning between states.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="hint">
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        You can keep track of the state of the robot using an integer, like we did in class.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You should now have the tools to complete your bug navigation, using the steps outlined above.
      Write your algorithm in the file <code>bug_navigation.cpp</code>.
      The code should ask the user for <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>theta</code> values for the goal, and drive to the given pose.
    </p>

      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo4">P2.4 Bug Navigation Demo (5 points):</strong>

        For full points, your robot will need to drive to a goal given given by course staff.
        Staff will test 2-3 runs of your bug navigation.

    <h2><a href="#code">Code Overview</a></h2>
  </header>

  <p>
    For Project 2, we will compile and run our code the same way as in <a href="/projects/a1.html">Project 1</a>.
    To build the code, in a terminal, type:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">cd ~/[my-bug-nav-dir]/build
cmake ..
make</code></pre>

  <p>
    Remember that the code should be cloned and compiled on the Raspberry Pi. This will fail on your computer!
    You should replace <code>[my-bug-nav-dir]</code> with the name of your bug navigation directory.
    For a review of what these commands do, see <a href="/projects/a1.html#code">the Project 1 description</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Repository structure</h3>

  <p>The repository includes the following dirctories and files:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>build</code>: Build files and executables should be generated here. All commands to compile code should be executed inside this directory. The contents are not pushed to GitHub.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>include</code>: Header files are stored in this directory. These allow us to include code written in separate files in our code.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>omnibot_msgs</code>: These are message types which are needed for communicating with the MBot.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>src</code>: Source code and executables are stored here. <strong>All your changes should be in this folder</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>: Instructions for CMake to use to find dependencies and compile executables.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Provided functions</h3>

  <p>To use provided functions, all you need to do is include the correct header file. The needed header files should already be included in the templates. The following functions are provided:</p>

  <ul class="hint">
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
      <code>void drive(float vx, float vy, float wz)</code>: Send a velocity command to the motors. The velocity command has x and y components in meters per second (<code>vx</code> and <code>vy</code>) and an angular component in radians per second (<code>wz</code>).<br/>
      <strong>Warning:</strong> Once <code>drive</code> is called, the robot will continue to drive at the given speed until you tell it to stop! Use <code>drive(0, 0, 0)</code> to stop the robot.
    </li>
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
      <code>void getLidarScan(std::vector&lt;float&gt;&amp; ranges, std::vector&lt;float&gt;&amp; thetas)</code>: Read the most recent Lidar scan and put the resulting ranges in the <code>ranges</code> vector, and angles in the <code>thetas</code> vector. <br/>
      <strong>Warning:</strong> Some rays in the scan never return (for example, if there are no obstacles, or the ray bounces off a material and goes in a different direction). If the ray does not return, its range will be zero. Make sure you check for rays with zero range and ignore them.
    </li>
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
      <code>void sleepFor(float secs)</code>: Sleep for a given number of seconds.
    </li>
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
      <code>float wrapAngle(float angle)</code>: Normalize an angle in the range [-pi, pi]. This function returns the normalized angle.
    </li>
  </ul>
