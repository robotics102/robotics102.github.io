  <h2 id="getting_code">Getting the Code</h2>

  <p>One repository per team will be created for this project. Both teammates will have access to the repository and will be able to view it and make changes. Both teammates will share ownership of the code and receive credit for writing the code through the license file.</p>

  <p><strong>The invite link to accept the assignment on Github Classroom can be found on Slack.</strong></p>

  <p>The first teammate to accept will need to create a new team. The team must be named <strong>team &#35;&#35;</strong>.  Replace <strong>&#35;&#35;</strong> with the team number assigned to you (for example, team 01, team 11, etc.). The next teammate should join the team from the list of existing teams.</p>

  <span class="image main"><img src="/assets/images/p1/git_create_team.png" alt="" style="max-width:600px;"/></span>

  <p>You will be cloning the repository <em>on the robot's Raspberry Pi</em>.
    See the <a href="/tutorials/robot.html#sec_conn_robot">robot tutorial</a> for instructions on how to open a remote VSCode session connected to the robot. Once you are connected to the robot, in VSCode, open a terminal. This should be a terminal in the robot's Raspberry Pi. Then, clone the repository in the home directory:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-bash">git clone &lt;ADDRESS&gt;</code></pre>
  <p>Substitute <strong>&ltADDRESS&gt</strong> with the git address found on github. Open the folder of the repository you just cloned in VSCode using the instructions in the <a href="/tutorials/robot.html#sec_code_robot">tutorial</a>.</p>

  <hr class="major" />

  <h2 id="submitting">Submitting your assignment</h2>

  <p>
    Your submission for this assignment should include your code and a website portfolio of your project.
    The website should feature video demonstrations of your robot completing each of the two parts of this assignment and a brief discussion.
    The link to your website should be placed in the README of your GitHub repository.
    For details about what should be on the website, see <a href="#website">Project Website</a>.
    You should make one submission for your team. Teammates will be graded together.

    <h2><a href="#code">Code Overview</a></h2>
  </header>

  <p>In <a href="/projects/a0.html">Project 0</a>, we compiled our C++ code on Replit. Replit took care of calling the C++ compiler and generating an executable that we could run. This time, we have a bit more code to deal with. The wall follower code will have dependencies on external libraries to drive the robot and read data from the Lidar. We could compile the source code directly by running a similar command to Replit, but the command would be much longer and more complicated. Instead, we'll use a tool called <strong>CMake</strong>. CMake finds all the code and external libraries we need and generates instructions to build the executable. To build the code, in a terminal, type:</p>

  <pre><code class="language-bash">cd ~/[my-wall-follower-dir]/build
cmake ..
make</code></pre>

  <p>
    Remember that the code should be cloned and compiled on the Raspberry Pi. This will fail on your computer!
    You should replace <code>[my-wall-follower-dir]</code> with the name of your wall follower directoy.
    Let's look at these instructions line by line:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <code>cd ~/[my-wall-follower-dir]/build</code>:
      Changes the directory to the <code>build</code> folder, where all the files CMake needs will be generated. The executables will also be in this folder. Keeping all the files related to compilation in <code>build</code> keeps our code organized.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>cmake ..</code>:
      Calls CMake, and tells it to use the instructions in the file <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> which is located in the root of the repository to generate instructions to compile the code. Generally, <code>cmake ..</code> only needs to be called once, not every time you change your code.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>make</code>:
      Compiles the code, using the instructions generated by CMake (called Makefiles). You need to rerun <code>make</code> every time you change the code.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Repository structure</h3>

  <p>The repository includes the following dirctories and files:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>build</code>: Build files and executables should be generated here. All commands to compile code should be executed inside this directory. The contents are not pushed to GitHub.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>include</code>: Header files are stored in this directory. These allow us to include code written in separate files in our code.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>omnibot_msgs</code>: These are message types which are needed for communicating with the MBot.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>src</code>: Source code and executables are stored here. <strong>All your changes should be in this folder</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>: Instructions for CMake to use to find dependencies and compile executables.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Provided functions &amp; structs</h3>

  <p>To use provided functions, all you need to do is include the correct header file. The needed header files should already be included in the templates. The following functions are provided:</p>

  <ul class="hint">
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
      <code>void drive(float vx, float vy, float wz)</code>: Send a velocity command to the motors. The velocity command has x and y components in meters per second (<code>vx</code> and <code>vy</code>) and an angular component in radians per second (<code>wz</code>).<br/>
      <strong>Warning:</strong> Once <code>drive</code> is called, the robot will continue to drive at the given speed until you tell it to stop! Use <code>drive(0, 0, 0)</code> to stop the robot.
    </li>
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
      <code>void getLidarScan(std::vector&lt;float&gt;&amp; ranges, std::vector&lt;float&gt;&amp; thetas)</code>: Read the most recent Lidar scan and put the resulting ranges in the <code>ranges</code> vector, and angles in the <code>thetas</code> vector. <br/>
      <strong>Warning:</strong> Some rays in the scan never return (for example, if there are no obstacles, or the ray bounces off a material and goes in a different direction). If the ray does not return, its range will be zero. Make sure you check for rays with zero range and ignore them.
    </li>
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
      <code>void sleepFor(double secs)</code>: Sleep for a given number of seconds.
    </li>
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
      <code>double normalizeAngle(double angle)</code>: Normalize an angle in the range [-pi, pi]. This function returns the normalized angle.
    </li>
  </ul>

<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
<section id="proj_desc">
  <header class="major">
    <h2><a href="#proj_desc">Project Description</a></h2>
  </header>

  <p>This project is separated into two parts. Most of the time you spend on this project should be spent on part 2.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="#sec_square">Part 1</a>: Intended to help you get used to programming the robot and sending velocity commands to drive it. </li>
    <li><a href="#sec_wall_follow">Part 2</a>: The wall follower. </li>
  </ol>

  <p>A number of functions have been provided for you along with the template code. Make sure you read the <a href="#code">code overview</a> to learn how to use them.</p>

  <h3 id="sec_square">Part 1: Drive Square</h3>

  <p>We will start by driving the robot in a square without any sensor feedback. For this part, you will write your code in the file <code>src/drive_square.cpp</code>. In the <code>main</code> function, write code to make the robot drive in a 1 meter by 1 meter square three times. The square is not expected to be perfect.</p>

  <ul class="todo">
    <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
      <strong><a href="#todo1_1">P1.1</a> (2 points) DEMO:</strong>
      Demonstrate your robot driving in a square three times to a member of the course staff.
      You should write your code in the file <code>drive_square.cpp</code>.
      Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul class="hint">
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong> You can use the <code>drive()</code> function together with the <code>sleepFor()</code> function to make the robot drive in one direction for a certain amount of time. To drive in a square, you might drive forward for one second, left for one second, backward for one second, then right for one second.</li>
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong> Start by writing code to drive the robot in a square once. Then, you can add a <code>for</code> loop to repeat the pattern however many times you would like.</li>
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong> It's good practice to create variables in the <code>main</code> function to store constants. For example, you might want to define variables to store the velocity you are driving at, the number of seconds to drive for, and the number of times to repeat the square.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="sec_wall_follow">Part 2: Wall Following</h3>

  <p>
    Now that we have gotten used to controlling the robot and reading Lidar data, we're ready to code a wall follower!
    The wall follower should run forever, until the program is stopped with Ctrl-C. At each iteration, the wall follower should do the following:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Find the distance to the nearest wall and the angle where the wall is located (use <code>findMinDist()</code> for this part).</li>
    <li>Use the cross product to find a vector pointing parallel to the wall, in the direction the robot should drive.</li>
    <li>Apply a correction to the vector using bang-bang or P-control to move closer to or farther from the wall, depending on the current distance to the wall.</li>
    <li>Convert the vector to a velocity vector and send a velocity command to the robot.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>First, we need to write code to find the distance to the nearest obstacle. Calling the function <code>getLidarScan()</code> fills the <code>ranges</code> vector passed to it with the length, or <em>range</em>, of each ray in the scan in meters. The distance to the nearest obstacle is the range of the shortest ray in the scan.</p>

  <p>
    Complete the provided function, <code>findMinDist()</code>, in <code>src/common/utils.cpp</code> so that it finds the <em>index</em> of the shortest ray. For example, if the smallest range in <code>ranges</code> is the tenth element at index 9, the function should return 9.
  </p>

  <ul class="todo">
    <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
      <strong id="todo2_1">P1.2.1 (2 points):</strong> In the file <code>src/common/utils.cpp</code>, complete the function <code>findMinDist()</code> so that it finds the minimum length ray in the given scan. Return the <em>index</em> of this ray.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul class="hint">
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong> Remember to ignore rays with zero range when finding the minimum range value. Rays with zero range are invalid. If you forget to check for invalid rays, the minimum range will always be zero.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Next, you will need to write the cross product function, in the provided function in <code>src/common/utils.cpp</code>. </p>

  <ul class="todo">
    <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
      <strong id="todo2_2">P1.2.2 (2 points):</strong> In the file <code>src/common/utils.cpp</code>, complete the function <code>crossProduct()</code> to find the cross product between two vectors. The input should be two vectors of length 3, corresponding to the x, y, and z components of the input vectors. The output should be a vector of length 3 corresponding to the components of the resulting cross product.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul class="hint">
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong> For a vector <code>v</code>, the x component should be stored in <code>v[0]</code>, the y component should be stored in <code>v[1]</code>, and the z component should be stored in <code>v[2]</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Once both functions are completed, you are ready to write your wall follower. The wall follower code should go in <code>src/wall_follower.cpp</code>. You can implement either the bang-bang controller or the P-controller discussed in class.</p>

  <ul class="todo">
    <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
      <strong><a href="#todo2_3">P1.2.3</a> (5 points) DEMO:</strong>
      Demonstrate that your robot can follow a wall to course staff.
      For full points, your robot should successfully complete two laps around a course defined on Demo Day.
      You should write your code in the file <code>wall_follower.cpp</code> using the procedure outlined above.
      You will need to use your functions <code>findMinDist()</code> and <code>crossProduct()</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ul class="hint">
    <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong> You should create variables to store the setpoint (how far your robot should stay from the wall) and the magnitude of the correction you will apply. You might also want to declare an acceptable margin where you won't apply a correction, and the velocity of the robot. These values will need to be tuned to make your wall follower work well!</li>

<!-- Website -->
<section id="website">
  <header class="major">
    <h2><a href="#website">Project Website</a></h2>
  </header>

  <p>Create a website to demonstrate your implementation of the wall follower. The easiest method to create a website is to use Google Sites. You can instead create a project page on a GitHub repository, or use your favorite method to create a website. Note that if you chose to use GitHub pages, you will need to create a separate, public repository. Include at least one video demo of your wall follower as well as a brief summary and discussion of your algorithm. Add the link to your project page to the <code>README.md</code> file in the root of your repository and push it to GitHub.</p>

  <p><em>Note:</em> To include the video on the webpage, consider uploading your video to YouTube. Alternatively, you can upload your video to Google Drive (you have unlimited storage through your UM account). If you do this, make sure the link is accessible to the instructors when they access the web page.</p>

  <p>Include a discussion section on the web page, where you discuss the following:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Your choice of control algorithm (bang-bang or P-control)</li>
    <li>The strengths and limitations of the algorithm</li>
    <li>How you might improve the algorithm (include at least one idea)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Include images or videos whenever possible to illustrate your points. Keep the discussion brief: it should be no longer than a few sentences.</p>
