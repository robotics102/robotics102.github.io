    <strong>Tutorial:</strong> Using the ROB 102 Navigation Web App
  </header>

  <p><span class="image right"><img src="/images/tutorials/webapp/nav-app-overview.png" alt="" /></span>
    The <strong>ROB 102 Navigation Web App</strong> is a web-based application that allows you to
    visualize the paths generated by your DFS, BFS, and A-STAR search algorithms.<br>
    Once you implement DFS, BFS, and A-STAR, you can use the nav_cli, which is included
    with the project 3 starter code, to generate output which the web app can visualize for
    you. This tutorial will show you how to generate those files on replit and use the
    webapp.

  <p>
    Before using the path planner on a given map, you may like to visualize the map
    to select the start and goal cells for you plan. To do this, we need to
    first download the map file which we could like to visualize to our computer.
  </p>
  <p>
    To download a map file from replit, open the <strong>data</strong> folder, which is where all the
    maps are stored, find the map you would like to download, then click the 3 dots
    that appear next to the file when you hover over it. This will give you a drop down menu
    where you can select the <strong>Download</strong> option to download the file to your
    computer.

  <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
    Once download, navigate to <a href="robotics102.github.io/nav-app/">robotics102.github.io/nav-app/</a>
    Once open, click <strong>Upload Map File</strong>. This will open your file explorer where
    you can then select the map file that you downloaded, and upload it to the nav app. Once uploaded
    the map will automatically display. We now have the ability to click on the map to retrieve
    different cell values from the map to use to generate plans.

  </header>

  <p>
    The main use of the web app is to visualize both the plan that your search algorithms generate
    along with show the order which your search algorithm visits cells. You find that the starter
    code provides a command line interface (cli), named nav_cli, which is used to generate the
    necessary data to allow the web app to visualize a search path and visited cells.
  </p>
  <p>
    To start, first navigate to your project on replit and open a terminal in replit.
    In the terminal, run <code>cd build && cmake ..</code> to generate the Makefile.
    Then run <code>make</code>. This will generate the application <code>nav_cli</code>.
    Assuming your code compiles, you should end up with something that looks as follows:
  </p>
  <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
    <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/images/tutorials/webapp/compiled-nav-cli.png" alt="" />
    <figcaption>Image: Compiled nav cli</figcaption>
  </div>
  <p>
    Now that the <code>nav_cli</code> is compiled, we can use it to run out search algorithms.
    The <code>nav_cli</code> is used as follows:

    <code>./nav_cli [map_file] [planning_algo] [start_x] [start_y] [goal_x] [goal_y]</code>
    where <code>[map_file]</code> is the map which we would like to use, <code>[planning_algo]</code>
    is the desired search algorithm we would like to use (one of bfs, dfs, or astar), <code>[start_x]</code>
    and <code>[start_y]</code> are the starting cell x and y coordinates, respectively, and
    <code>[goal_x]</code> and <code>[goal_y]</code> are the goal cell x and y
    coordinates, respectively.
    <br>
    <br>
    Try running <code>./nav_cli ../data/maze1.map astar 21 88 86 18</code>.
    Assuming your code works properly, you will end up with the following output:
  </p>
  <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
    <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/images/tutorials/webapp/nav-cli-map1-output.png" alt="" />
    <figcaption>Image: using nav_cli</figcaption>
  </div>

  <p>
    <code>nav_cli</code> generates an output file, named <code>out.planner</code> located in the
    <code>build</code> folder of your project. You will be able to open the file and see
    its contents, which will look as follows: 
  </p>

  <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
    <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/images/tutorials/webapp/generated-nav-output.png" alt="" />
    <figcaption>Image: generated nav output</figcaption>
  </div>

  <p>
    Copy all the contents of that file, and navigate back to the web app. Paste this output
    in the text entry box and click <code>submit.</code> One done, you will see the map appear
    and the robot will be located at the start cell. Then, click <code>Plan!</code> and watch the
    generated plan come to life!
