    <p>In this project, we will write a <strong>path planning algorithm</strong>, which will find a path to any goal in a map. When you've completed the project, you'll be able to find paths like this one:</p>

    <span class="image main"><img src="/images/p3/bfs_path.png" alt="" style="max-width:600px;"/></span>

    <p>This project will have two components: an individual component where you plan paths throughout a map of Michigan, and a group component where you plan paths in a robot map.</p>

    <h2 id="getting_code">Getting the Code</h2>

    <p>For Part 1 of this project, you can find the template code <a href="https://replit.com/team/robotics-102-f22/Planning-in-Michigan">on Replit here</a>.</p>

    <p>For Part 2 of this project, one repository per team will be created for this project through GitHub Classroom, like in Projects 1 and 2. Both teammates will share ownership of the code and receive credit for writing the code through the license file.</p>

    <p><strong>The invite link to accept the assignment on Github Classroom can be found on Slack.</strong></p>

    <p>
      The first teammate to accept will need to create a new team. The team must be named <strong>P3 F22 Team &#35;&#35;</strong>.
      Replace <strong>&#35;&#35;</strong> with the team number assigned to you (for example, P3 F22 Team 01, P3 F22 Team 11, etc.).
      The next teammate should join the team from the list of existing teams.
    </p>

    <h3 id="replit">Editing the code on Replit</h3>

    <p>For this project, we have created some tools so that you can develop and test your planning algorithms on Replit, without using the robot. When your code is working, you can then run it on the robot. </p>

    <p>Replit supports cloning, running, and committed changes to GitHub repositories. Since the project repos are private, we have created an empty project on Replit within the Robotics 102 team which you can use to collaborate with your teammates on a private Replit. To run and edit your code on Replit, follow these steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Connect your Replit account to GitHub</strong> (all teammates). Click on your username on the top left corner of the Replit page and select &quot;Account&quot;. Scroll all the way to the bottom to &quot;Connected Services&quot; and select &quot;Connect&quot; beside the GitHub option.</li>
      <li><strong>Accept the assignment on GitHub Classroom</strong> (all teammates). This step is just like in Projects 1 and 2.</li>
      <li><strong>Fork the Replit Project</strong> (one teammate). On our class Replit team, select the project &quot;Project 3: Path Planning&quot; from the list. You will be prompted to join or create a new group. Select the option to create a new group. Make sure you tell your teammate(s) your Replit username.</li>
      <li><strong>Join the Replit Project</strong> (other teammate(s)). Join the group that your teammate has created by selecting their username.</li>
      <li><strong>Connect your GitHub repo</strong>. Your new project on Replit should be empty. You will connect it to your existing project repo on GitHub. To do this, click on the Version Control panel and select the option to connect to an existing repo:
        <span class="image main"><img src="/images/p3/connect_git.png" alt="" style="max-width:600px;"/></span>
      Paste the address of your repo in the popup that appears and click the button to pull the changes from the repo.
        <span class="image main"><img src="/images/p3/select_repo.png" alt="" style="max-width:500px;"/></span>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Delete the file <code>tmp.txt</code> from the Replit project.</strong> This is there because Replit does not allow empty repositories.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>All code developed on Replit should be pushed to GitHub.</strong> You can do this using the Version Control tab on the Repl. The instructors will not use Replit to view your code, so you should not submit it on Replit. If you are editing code on the robot, make sure your Replit project stays up to date by pulling new code. You can do this in the Version Control tab.</p>

    <ul class="hint">
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        Replit uses 2 spaces for indentation by default, but our code uses 4 spaces.
        You can modify the indent size in the Repl to 4 to make it easier to view the project code.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="license">Completing the License</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>Modify the LICENSE.txt file to include the names of all teammates.</strong>
      Make sure the change is committed to your repository.
      This must be completed in order for your project to be graded, but this time, points are not awarded for completed the license.
    </p>

    <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo0">P3.0 (0 points):</strong> In the file <code>LICENSE.txt</code>, replace
        <code>&lt;COPYRIGHT HOLDER&gt;</code> with the names of all teammates, separated by commas. Replace
        <code>&lt;YEAR&gt;</code> with the current year.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr class="major" />

    <h2 id="submitting">Submitting the Assignment</h2>

    <p>For Part 1 of the assignment, each student should complete the code on Replit individually. Use the <strong>&quot;Submit&quot;</strong> button to submit your assignment.</p>

    <p>For Part 2 of the assignment, teammates will be graded together. You should push your code to your GitHub repository, and create a project webpage for your completed project. Include a link to your webpage in the <code>README.md</code> of your repository. For details about what should be on the website, see <a href="#website">Project Website</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="grading">Grading Breakdown</h3>

    <hr class="major" />

    <h2 id="part1_michigan">Part 1: Path Planning in Michigan</h2>

    <p>
      The goal of this part of the project is to find a path using the Breadth First Search algorithm through Michigan.
      The Michigan map we will be using looks like this:
    </p>

    <span class="image main"><img src="/images/p3/michigan.png" alt="" style="max-width:600px;"/></span>

    <p>
      The graph data is stored in a text file called <code>mi_graph.txt</code>. It contains a list of cities, which are nodes in the graph, followed by a list of edges between the nodes. The edges are denoted by the names of the two connected cities, followed by the distance in miles between the cities.
    </p>

    <ul class="hint">
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        You can modify the map (for example, add some cities)!
        To do this, add the name of the city under where it says <code>NODES</code>.
        Add the edges connected to the new city under where it says <code>EDGES</code>, following format (one line per edge):
        <pre><code>[my_new_city] [connected_city] [miles_between_cities]</code></pre>
        Don't forget to update the numbers beside the headings <code>NODES</code> and <code>EDGES</code> to reflect the total number of nodes and edges respectively.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The map data is stored in a struct called <code>Graph</code>, defined for you, which looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">struct Graph
{
    std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; data;
    std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;int&gt; &gt; edges;
    std::vector&lt;std::vector&lt;float&gt; &gt; edge_costs;

    // TODO: Add any members you need to the graph.
};</code></pre>

    <p>
      The function <code>createGraph("mi_graph.txt")</code> populates a struct of type <code>Graph</code> with the Michigan map data defined in <code>mi_graph.txt</code>.
      The struct contains a vector of strings <code>data</code>, which stores a list of all the cities.
      We will use the index of the city in this vector to identify the node.
      You can get the number of nodes in the graph using <code>data.size()</code>.
      You can use function <code>nameToIdx("my_city", g.data)</code> to get the index of a city from its name.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vectors <code>edges</code> and <code>edge_costs</code> store the edges connecting the node and the distances of those edges respectively.
      <emph>You should not need to access these directly.</emph>
      Use functions <code>getNeighbors(idx, g)</code> to get a list of the indices of the neighbors of node at index <code>idx</code>, and <code>getEdgeCosts(idx, g)</code> to get a list of the distances to the neighboring cities.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Storing node data:</strong> First, decide how to store the various node data which you need to access in the BFS algorithm.
      Add data to the <code>Graph</code> struct to store this data.
      Make sure you store the index of the parent node during the search.
      The final path will be found by tracing backwards through the parents, starting from the goal node, using function <code>tracePath(goal_idx, g)</code> (where <code>goal_idx</code> is the index of the goal node).
    </p>

        <strong id="todo1_1">P3.1.1:</strong>
        Design a way to store node data needed in BFS.
        Add members to the <code>Graph</code> struct to store this data.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Initializing node data:</strong>
      You should start by initializing data for each node of the graph, before the algorithm starts, so you can access and update it during your algorithm. This is done in function <code>initGraph()</code>.
    </p>

     <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_2">P3.1.2:</strong>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Accessing node data:</strong>
      For the function <code>tracePath()</code> to work, it should be able to use function <code>getParent(idx, g)</code> to get the index of the parent of the node at <code>idx</code>. Complete the <code>getParent(idx, g)</code> function to access the parent of a node.
    </p>

      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo1_3">P3.1.3:</strong>

    <ul class="hint">
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        If your function <code>initGraph()</code> initializes the parent of all nodes to be -1, your <code>getParent()</code> function will automatically return the correct result for nodes with no parents, without extra logic.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        The start node should not have a parent.

    <p>
      <strong>Breadth First Search:</strong>
      Complete the function <code>bfs()</code> to find a path from the start to the goal node.
      Maintain a visit list containing node indices as a queue data structure.
      Use the function <code>getNeighbors(idx, g)</code> to get the neighbors of node with index <code>idx</code> within graph <code>g</code>.
      When the goal is found, use the following code to get the path as a vector of node indices.
      This should work as written if you have maintained the parents of the nodes correctly and implemented <code>getParent()</code>, assuming <code>goal_idx</code> is the index of the goal node.

    <hr class="major" />

    <h2 id="part2_robot">Part 2: Path Planning on the Robot</h2>

    <p>In this part of the project, we will implement Breadth First Search within robot maps. We also provide an advanced extension to implement the <a href="#astar">A-Star search algorithm</a>, as discussed in lecture.</p>

    <p>
      To help you develop your algorithm, we have created a webapp which you can use to test your algorithm.
      You can find a tutorial on how to use it <a href="/tutorials/app.html">here</a>.
      The code can be run in Replit for testing purposes, using provided test maps, or maps that you have downloaded from the robot.
      It will output a file that you can use in the webapp to visualize your code.
      Once your planning algorithm is working, you can run it on your robot using a real robot map.
    </p>

    <h3 id="sec_graph">Grid Graph</h3>

    <p>Information about the map for a particular environment is stored in a provided struct called <code>GridGraph</code>, described in <a href="#code_utils_gridgraph">the code overview</a>. You can visualize the available maps using the <a href="/tutorials/app.html">webapp</a>.</p>

    <p>A number of helper functions are available for you to use. Review them in the <a href="#code_utils">code overview</a>.</p>

    <p>
      You will need to complete the function <code>findNeighbors()</code>.
      The neighbors of a cell are the adjacent cells in the graph.
      This function will be necessary in order to complete your planning algorithm.
    </p>

    <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo2_1">P3.2.1:</strong> In the file <code>graph_utils.cpp</code>, complete functions <code>findNeighbors()</code>.
        It should accept the index of a node and return a vector of indices of neighboring nodes.
        You may use either 4-connected or 8-connected neighbors, as discussed in lab.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="hint">
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        You might find the functions <code>idxToCell()</code> and <code>cellToIdx()</code> helpful.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- <p>We have provided a test script to check your indexing functions. Compile your code either on Replit or on the robot, then run the test script in the Docker like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">cd /code/build
cmake ..
make
./test_graph</code></pre> -->

    <!-- <p>The tests should pass before you move on to the next step. You may add more tests if you would like.</p> -->

    <h3 id="sec_node">Storing Node Data</h3>

    <p>In order to perform graph search, we need to keep track of a few things for each cell:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The cell's parent along the current path,</li>
        <li>The distance from the start node to the cell along the current path,</li>
        <li>Whether the cell has been visited.</li>
        <!-- <li>(A-Star only) The cell's score.</li> -->
      </ol>

    <p>Using the concepts we have learned so far, design code to store this data. Then, modify <code>GridGraph</code> to store the node information. You may extend your implementation to store any additional information you need.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The nodes should be indexed the same way as the cells, as a single vector. You can use the <code>cellToIdx()</code> and <code>idxToCell()</code> functions to access node data for a specific cell.</p>

    <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo2_2">P3.2.2:</strong>
        In the <code>graph_utils.h</code> file, design a data structure to store the cell information and modify <code>GridGraph</code> to add any new member variables accordingly.

        <strong id="todo2_3">P3.2.3:</strong>
        In the <code>graph_utils.cpp</code> file, complete function <code>initGraph()</code> to initialize the cell data. You can assume the graph will be loaded when the function is called.

    </ul>

    <ul class="hint">
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        You might consider implementing a struct to represent your cell node and store a vector of cell node structs in <code>GridGraph</code>. Alternatively, you might consider adding a few vectors to the <code>GridGraph</code> struct to store the relevant information.
      </li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs">
        <strong>Hint:</strong>
        The start node and unexplored nodes should not have parents.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="sec_bfs">Breadth First Search</h3>

    <p>In this section, you will write code to implement a <strong>Breadth First Search (BFS)</strong> over a graph, given a start and goal cell. You will write your code in the file <code>src/graph_search/graph_search.cpp</code>. Your code should go in the function <code>breadthFirstSearch()</code>, which looks like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">std::vector<Cell> breadthFirstSearch(GridGraph& graph, const Cell& start, const Cell& goal)
{
  std::vector<Cell> path;  // The final path should be placed here.
  initGraph(graph);  // Make sure all the node values are reset.
  int start_idx = cellToIdx(start.i, start.j, graph);

  /**
   * TODO (P3): Implement BFS.
   */

  return path;
}</code></pre>
    <p>Assume the graph is loaded with the corresponding map data. The function first calls <code>initGraph()</code> to make sure that all the nodes are initialized. The start and goal position are passed in as <code>Cell</code> structs.<code>Cell</code> has two integer member variables: <code>i</code> and <code>j</code>, corresponding to the row and column coordinates of the cell. When the path is found, your code should store the path in the provided vector, <code>path</code>. You can use the provided function <code>tracePath()</code>, as follows:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">path = tracePath(goal_idx, graph);</code></pre>
    <p>where <code>goal_idx</code> is an integer value which stores the index of the goal. If you have correctly maintained the parent structure of the cells and the <code>idxToCell()</code> and <code>getParent()</code> functions are implemented, this will return the path to the start node. The start node should not have a parent. If no path was found, your code should return an empty vector. Use <code>checkCollision()</code> to check whether a cell is in collision.</p>

    <p>The webapp allows you to play back which cells are visited in your algorithm. It will show visited cells in grey so you can visualize the order that the cells are explored. To visualize the visited cells, you should add the cell to the vector <code>graph.visited_cells</code>, as follows (given that the current cell is stored in <code>Cell</code> struct <code>c</code>):</p>
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">graph.visited_cells.push_back(c);</code></pre>

    <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todo2_5">P3.2.5:</strong>
        In the <code>graph_search.cpp</code> file, implement Breadth First Search in function <code>breadthFirstSearch()</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="hint">
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong> BFS maintains a list of nodes to visit using a First-In-First-Out data structure (or a queue). C++ has a queue implementation called <code>std::queue</code>. Assuming you have a queue <code>q</code>, <code>q.push(my_node_idx)</code> will push a value onto the back of the queue, <code>q.front()</code> will return the value at the front of the queue, and <code>q.pop()</code> will remove the first element of the queue.</li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong> Your visit list should store integers corresponding to the indices of the nodes of interest. You can use these indices to retrieve and modify cell data directly in the graph. Do not push any structs your graph stores onto the visit list! This makes a <emph>copy</emph> of the data, so any changes you make would not be reflected in the graph.</li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong> You should not add any cells which are in collision to your visit list.</li>
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong>If you complete the Distance Transform advanced extension, you can use <code>checkCollisionFast()</code> to check collisions. This requires that you call your distance transform function first. The results will be slightly different than <code>checkCollision()</code> if you use the Manhattan distance transform, but both are valid.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="sec_robot">Path Planning on the Robot</h3>

    <p>You will write code to search for and drive along a path on the robot in the file <code>src/robot_plan_path.cpp</code>. We have provided a function <code>drivePath(std::vector<Cell>& path, GridGraph& graph)</code> which will send the robot a command to follow the path defined in vector of cells <code>path</code>. This function sends a path to the motion controller. Modify the provided code template to call your path planning algorithm and then send the path to the robot.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> The utility function <code>loadFromFile()</code> initializes the radius for collision checking to the robot radius, stored in variable <code>ROBOT_RADIUS</code>, plus the width of one cell. You might want to make the collision radius larger on the robot, so that your planner is more conservative on the robot. To do this modify the value of <code>graph.collision_radius</code> after the map is loaded.</p>

      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong> The provided function <code>drivePath()</code> returns immediately after sending the path command to motion controller.

    </ul>

    <p>Before you run the code, you should make a map of the environment you want to run in. Once you have made a map, switch the robot into localization only mode.</p>

    <p>To compile and run path planning on the robot, connect to the robot using VSCode. Then, from inside the repository you cloned onto the robot, compile as follows:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">cd build
cmake -DOMNIBOT=On ..
make</code></pre>

    <p>Do not forget the argument <code>-DOMNIBOT=On</code> when running CMake. This is how the compiler knows whether to compile the robot code (which is not compiled by default for testing in Replit). To run the planning algorithm, in the <code>build</code> folder where you compiled, do:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">./robot_plan_path [PATH/TO/MAP] [goal_x] [goal_y]</code></pre>
    <p>The map is stored in <code>~/mbot-bin/maps/current.map</code>. Use that path if you did not move the map since creating it. You can also pass in <code>goal_x</code> and <code>goal_y</code>, the global position of the goal, relative to the starting position of your map, in meters. If you do not pass these in, they will default to zero.</p>

    <p>When you pass in arguments to the code, do not include the square brackets.</p>

    <h2 id="adv_ext">Advanced Extensions</h2>

    <h3 id="astar">A-Star Search</h3>

    <p>As an advanced extension, you may write code to implement <strong>A-Star Search</strong> over a graph, given a start and goal cell. You will write your code in the file <code>src/graph_search/graph_search.cpp</code>. Your code should go in the function <code>aStarSearch()</code>. This function looks a lot like the one for <a href="#sec_bfs">BFS</a>. However, you will need to maintain the f-score of the nodes you explore. Modify your cell node data to include the f-score of the node. In the <code>graph_utils.cpp</code> file, implement the function <code>getScore()</code> to return a double corresponding to the f-score of the given cell index.</p>

    <p>In A-Star, the next node to explore is the one with the <emph>lowest f-score</emph>. The function <code>findLowestScore()</code> takes a <code>std::vector</code> of integers as an argument, along with the graph, and returns the index of the lowest score node <emph>in the list</emph>. You can use this function as follows to get the lowest scoring node, and then remove it from the list:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-cpp">int min_score_idx = findLowestScore(visit_list, graph);
int current = visit_list[min_score_idx];
visit_list.erase(visit_list.begin() + min_score_idx);</code></pre>

    <ul class="todo">
      <li class="icon solid fa-laptop-code">
        <strong id="todoAE_3_i">Advanced Extension P3.i (1 extension point):</strong>
        In the <code>graph_search.cpp</code> file, implement A-Star Search in function <code>aStarSearch()</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="dt">Distance Transform (Manhattan)</h3>

    <p>A <strong>binary distance transform</strong> calculates the distance from each cell to the nearest occupied cell in a map.
    We can use this to check whether a cell is in collision quickly.
    The distance transform values can also be used to compute more interesting costs to visit a cell in a planning algorithm.
    The output should look something like the image below.
    The grey cells represent smaller distances to the nearest obstacle, and the white cells represent higher distances.</p>

    <span class="image main"><img src="/images/p2/dist_tf.png" alt="" style="max-width:600px;"/></span>

    <p>If you have completed this advanced extension, you can use function <code>checkCollisionFast()</code> in your path planning algorithms.</p>

    <p>
      A good starting point is to implement a slow version of the distance transform which gives us the Euclidean distance to each cell.
      This can be implmented in the function <code>distanceTransformSlow()</code> located in <code>src/potential_field/distance_transform.cpp</code>.
      To do this, for each unoccupied cell, we can calculate the distance between the current cell and every occupied cell in the graph.
      We store the smallest distance in the <code>graph.obstacle_distances</code> vector. This will help you get the hang of the idea, but is very slow! This algorithm alone is not worth extension points.
    </p>

    <ul class="hint">
      <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong> You can visualize your transform in the web app by modifying the function <code>initGraph()</code> so that it calls <code>distanceTransformSlow()</code>. If <code>graph.obstacle_distances</code> contains data, you should be able to see the distance transform when you toggle &quot;Show Distance Transform&quot; in the web app, after uploading the planning file.</li>
      <!-- <li class="icon solid fa-cogs"><strong>Hint:</strong> Can you make your algorithm any faster?</li> -->
    </ul>

    <p>
      To get the advanced extension point, you should implement a much faster algorithm for computing the distance transform, but which computes the Manhattan distance from each unoccupied cell to the nearest occupied cell.
      The 2D Distance Transform is discribed in <a href="https://youtu.be/5vI76u17-UE">this video lecture</a>
      [<a href="/lectures/rob102_07_distance_transform.pdf">Slides</a>].
      There is also an accompanying example which can be completed in Replit:
      [<a href="/lectures/in-class/files/dt.cpp">Template Code</a>]
      [<a href="/lectures/in-class/rob102_08_inclass_distance_transform.pdf">Slides</a>].
    </p>

    <p>
      Implement this algorithm in the function <code>distanceTransformManhattan()</code> located in <code>src/potential_field/distance_transform.cpp</code>.
      You can visualize your distance transform by modifying the function <code>initGraph()</code> so that it calls <code>distanceTransformManhattan()</code>.

    <p>For an additional advanced extension point, you can implement the fast Euclidean distance transform described in the notes linked above. The function <code>distanceTransformEuclidean2D()</code> is provided in the file <code>src/potential_field/distance_transform.cpp</code> to implement the algorithm. You may use function <code>distanceTransformEuclidean1D()</code> to implement the 1D version of the algorithm which is used within the 2D algorithm.</p>

  <p>
    Create a website to demonstrate your implementation of path planning.
    Add the link to your project page to the <code>README.md</code> file in the root of your repository and push it to GitHub.
    For a refresher about how to create the website, see the <a href="/projects/a1.html#website">Project 1 description</a>.
  </p>

  <p>On your project webpage, include multiple images and / or videos showing paths found by your breadth first search algorithm (and by A-Star, if applicable). Include examples of different maps, with different start and goal locations on the webapp. Include at least one video demonstration of your robot following a path and avoiding obstacles (for example, in a maze-like environment) using either BFS or A-Star. Remember to ensure that videos are visible by course staff.</p>

    <p>Include a discussion section on the web page. Consider the following questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>What are the strengths and limitations of breadth first search? Graph search in general?</li>
      <li>Does breadth first search always find the shortest path? Does A-Star always find the shortest path?</li>
      <li>How might you improve the algorithm(s) you implemented? (Include at least one idea)</li>
      <li>
        <em>(If you implemented A-Star)</em>
        In what types of environments is A-Star much faster than BFS? Are there any environments where A-Star is not much faster than BFS?

    <p>Consider including images or videos whenever possible to illustrate your points. Keep the discussion brief: it should be no longer than one or two paragraphs. If you did not implement A-Star, you may ignore the A-Star questions, or answer based on what we discussed in lecture.</p>
