    <strong>Project 4:</strong> Machine Learning for Image Classification
  </header>

  <p><font size="+2"><strong>Due December 8th, 2022 at 11:59 PM.</strong></font></p>

  <p>In this project, we will use machine learning algorithms to perform <strong>image classification</strong>. Image classification is the task of predicting the class, or label, of an image out of a set of known images. This is a type of <em>supervised learning</em>, which refers to algorithms that learn a function from labelled datasets.</p>

  <p>We will be writing algorithms to do image classification on the <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/" target="_blank">MNIST</a> dataset. MNIST consists of tiny 28&#215;28 pixel images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. A few example images from each are shown below.</p>

  <span class="image main"><img src="/images/p4/mnist.png" alt="" style="max-width:550px;"/></span>

  <p>MNIST has 60,000 images to train a classification algorithm, each labelled with the correct digit. In addition, there are 10,000 images which are used for testing the accuracy of the algorithm. We will implement three machine learning algorithms to classify images: <a href="#nearest_neighbor">nearest neighbors</a>, <a href="#linear_classifier">linear classification</a>, and a <a href="#neural_net">neural network</a>.</p>

  <p>
    This project is implemented using the Python programming language.
    We will be using the Python libraries NumPy and SciKit Learn.
    Before you start, make sure you have watched the <a href="/index.html#schedule_week12">Introduction to Python lecture</a>.
    There are a number of Python activities to help you practice, available on the <a href="/activities.html">Activities page</a>.

  <p>
    Parts 1 and 2 are done inidivually, using Google Colab.
    We have provided a Google Colab notebook which introduces the concepts of Jupyter Notebooks and using NumPy, available as a <a href="/activities.html">practice activity</a>.
  </p>

  <h3 id="nearest_neighbor">Part 1: Nearest Neighbors</h3>

    <p>In Part 1 of this project, you will implement a Nearest Neighbor classifier. The nearest neighbor algorithm takes a test image and finds the <em>closest</em> train image, which we call the image's nearest neighbor. Then, it assigns the test image the same label as its nearest neighbor. Here is an example of some MNIST images and their nearest neighbors:</p>

    <span class="image main"><img src="/images/p4/nearest_neighbor_mnist.png" alt="" style="max-width:600px;"/></span>

    <p>Open the notebook <code>Nearest Neighbors.ipynb</code> using the Google Drive link provided, and save a copy in your Drive. The notebook is made up of <em>cells</em>, which can be text cells (in Markdown) or code cells (in Python). You can run a cell by pressing the play button (<i class="fas fa-play"></i>) in the top left corner of the cell.</p>

    <p>You need to run a cell before you use anything it defines in another cell. For example, you should always run the imports cell when you start the notebook. Similarly, you must run a cell which defines a variable or function before running a cell that uses it. Start by running the import cell at the top of the notebook to import some dependencies we'll need later on.</p>

    <p>
      The text in the notebook contains descriptions of how the data is stored and how distance should be calculated. Places where you need to write code are noted in the comments, with the label <code>TODO</code>. Use the provided test cells to check that your functions are working correctly.
    </p>

    <p>
      <emph>Please read through the notebook carefully to make sure you do not miss any important instructions.</emph>
    </p>

  <h3 id="train_ml">Part 2: Training Machine Learning Algorithms</h3>

    <p>In this part, we will use a Python library called <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">SciKit Learn</a>. This library has implementations for multiple machine learning algorithms. We will focus on three of them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html">K-Nearest Neighbors</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.LinearSVC.html">Linear Classifier</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html">Neural Network</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will use the SciKit Learn implementations for each of these. Your job will be to train the best versions of the K-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Network algorithms using Cross Validation. The Linear Classifier will be used as a baseline (your Neural Network must outperform it!).</p>

    <p>
      Open the notebook <code>Machine Learning with SciKit Learn.ipynb</code> using the Google Drive link provided, and save a copy in your Drive.
      The text in the notebook guides you through each task. Places where you need to write code are noted in the comments, with the label <code>TODO</code>.
      <emph>Please read through the notebook carefully to make sure you do not miss any important instructions.</emph>
    </p>

    <p>
      The end of this notebook contains a cell which allows you to aave your favorite classification algorithm to a file.
      You should run it, then download the file for <a href="#tour_guide">Part 3</a>.
      With your partner, select the best algorithm from both of your notebooks to use.
    </p>

  <h3 id="tour_guide">Part 3: Robot Museum Tour Guide</h3>

    <p>
      Once you have trained a machine learning algorithm to recognize digits, you will use it on the robot to detect digits using the robot's camera. The robot's task will be to detect images in a museum (represented by a maze), and use the result to select which museum location to go to next. The waypoints corresponding to each digit will be provided by the instructors. The robot will use planning code from Project 3 to drive between the waypoints.
